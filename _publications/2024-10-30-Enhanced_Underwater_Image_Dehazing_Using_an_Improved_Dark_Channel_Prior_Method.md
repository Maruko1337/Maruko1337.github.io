excerpt: 'We propose an improved dehazing technique based on the Dark Channel Prior (DCP) method, called the Improved Dark Channel Prior (IDCP). The IDCP combines a novel airlight estimation strategy, termed Maximum Ratio Estimation (MRE), and an enhanced transmission map estimation method, termed Red Channel Retaining (RCR). IDCP incorporates the red channel, often overlooked in underwater imaging due to rapid attenuation, to improve color restoration and image clarity.'
